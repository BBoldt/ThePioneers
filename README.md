<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Pack logo by [CyanideX](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/CyanideX)</span>

<span style="font-size: 18pt;">**What is this pack?**</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">    If you're interested in seeing what 1.8.9 has to offer, this pack is for you! My goal is simply to make a playable pack, and showcase some new and interesting mods that have come out, while still offering a few of the classic "staple" mods that you may have used in the past. There are mods for people who like to build, explore, do magic, and automate. It feels very different due to the unique and new types of mods available, but it's definitely worth trying!</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">    After the initial release, I will not be adding more mods, only updating mods and improving the experience with the mods we have. There are some exceptions to this rule, but nothing major. This will result in the pack not becoming too bloated, and it will be easier to maintain. It should be noted that a lot of mods in this pack currently are very early releases, and there are definitely some bugs. I intend to keep working on it and working with mod creators on getting the issues fixed. This is not going to be a "throwaway" pack. That being said, make sure you make a lot of backups!</span>

<span style="font-size: 18pt;">**What is unique to this pack?**</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A few custom crops for Resourceful Crops, so you can grow Flamingos and Waffles. Very important.</span>
*   <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some recipe changes and balance tweaks, nothing too crazy.</span>
*   <span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">No conflicting ores, potion effects, etc. The standard "well thought out modpack" type stuff.</span>
*   <span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">Custom thaumcraft roguelike dungeon configs by Biochao on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/41hhm7/custom_roguelike_dungeon_189/</span>
*   <span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">Tooltips added to mods designating them as "Dangerous," "Unstable," "Semi-Stable", or "Stable." The mods marked "semi-stable" or "stable" are the least likely mods to crash you in the testing i've done so far. Be somewhat wary of mods marked "Dangerous" or "Unstable."</span>

<span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 13.3333px;">**FAQ:**</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 13.3333px;">*** HOW TO CREATE SERVER PLS?!**</span>

Download and install forge. Download modpack. Copy over the mods, configs, and scripts folders to your server. Remove clientside only mods listed above. Start server.

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">*** FPS IS BAD, I AM NOT GOOD FOR COMPUTER, PLZ TO HELP?!**</span>

If your FPS is low, first thing to do is check that you are dedicating enough memory. Curse Launcher sometimes sets you with something low by default. I recommend at least 4GB for this pack. If that doesn't work and you *reaaaaaalllly* want Optifine or BetterFPS, go right ahead. Just don't come complaining to me when stuff breaks because of it. :P 

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">*** WHY IS BUGS?!**</span>

A lot of the mods in this pack are a bit unstable, a lot of them are new, and a lot have been rewritten. Feel free to report any bugs you may find at the github link down below.

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px;">*** HOW FOR TO DOWNLOAD MODPACK WITHOUT CURSE LAUNCHER?!**</span>

There are a few tools you can use for this that can be found with google, both are on github.   
**curseDownloader** by **portablejim** will allow you to download modpacks with only that program. You can then put the files in multimc.

**modpack-helper** by **KaseiFR** will allow you to easily deploy servers with curse packs.
