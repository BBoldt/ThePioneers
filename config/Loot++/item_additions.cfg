    # - The item name will be what the item is registered as (there will be
    # a 'lootplusplus:' added to the front of it automatically; don't add
    # anything with a colon yourself!). Note that you should also add a model file with
    # this name in your resource pack in the folder assets/lootplusplus/models/item/<Item name>.json.
    # - The item display name is what people will see in-game.
    # - The texture location is the name of the png file you place in the resource 
    # pack, in the 'assets/minecraft/items' folder without the .png.
    # - If shines is true, the food item will shine like enchanted items.
    # - The food restored is the amount of food restored in half bars.
    # - The saturation is how much saturation is given by the food (time until you
    # get hungry again).- If wolves eat is true, wolves can eat the food.
    # - If always edible is true, you can eat the food even if you're not hungry.
    # - Time to eat is how long it takes to eat the item (32 normally).
    # - Finally the potions the food gives you is a list of potion effects in the format:
    # 
    #       ..._____<Potion effect id>-<Potion duration>-<Potion level (0 is 1)>-<Probability (between 0.0 and 1.0)>-<Particle type (normal, faded, or none)>_____...

    # - The <Innacuracy> is how much the thrown item will 'wobble'.
    # - The <Drop chance> is the chance that a drop will happen, from 0.0-1.0.
    # - The <Drops> is a list of drops the item will drop when it lands
    # in the same format as block and entity drops:
    # 
    #       ..._____i-<Item id>-<Min>-<Max>-<Weight (optional)>-<Metadata (optional)>-<NBT Tag (optional)>_____...

    # Make sure it's bigger than 0. If you don't specify the weight, it will default to 1.
    # - And the <Command> is a command you want to run where the block breaks.

    # a 'lootplusplus:' added to the front of it automatically; don't add
    # anything with a colon yourself!). Note that you should also add a model file with
    # this name in your resource pack in the folder assets/lootplusplus/models/item/<Item name>.json.
    # - The item display name is what people will see in-game.
    # - The material item name is the material that you can repair the tool with
    # which should be registered in the adding material section first.
    # 
    # So for instance, assuming that you added the ruby item
    # in the generic section and material for the item, you can add a ruby sword,
    # dagger, and big sword with:
    #       ruby_dagger_____Ruby Dagger_____lootplusplus:ruby_____2.0
    #       ruby_sword_____Ruby Sword_____lootplusplus:ruby_____4.0
    #       ruby_big_sword_____Ruby Big Sword_____lootplusplus:ruby_____6.0
    # 
    # Assuming you had a models for each in the folder mentioned above.
